I was on reddit recently and saw a post that was a line graph displayijg how Taylor Swift has been using the F word more and more over time in her albums.
One of the comments under the post said saomething about if you extrapolated this data, it would predict that she would be saying the F word several thousand times on one single album
I thought that was kinda funny, and also decided it would be a good way to practice some Python skills by doing the prediction and displaying it.
